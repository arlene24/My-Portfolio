# My Portfolio
This is my first project

This project was built using these tecnologies:

- Html 
- Css 
- Javascript 

## An Overview to my project

On this Personal Portfolio, there are five sections on one page – Home, About, Services, Skills, and Contact, and each section is attractive and eye-catching. On the home page of this site, on the top, there is a sticky navigation bar with a logo on the left side and some navigation links are on the right side. On the left side of the home page, there are texts which are about the author’s name, profession, and a button labeled as “Hire me” as you can see in the image.

### The Challenge 

- One of the challenges I have faced is to add the humburger menu to get the right max-width for the mobile responsiveness in css.
- Another challenge I have faced was to add the typing text animation script.

## What I have learned with this project:

- the ability to add typing text animation script

<h5>Some JS code I'm proud of</h5>

var typed = new Typed(".typing", {
        strings: ["Developer", "Designer", "Freelancer"],
        typeSpeed: 100,
        backSpeed: 60,
        loop: true
    });

    var typed = new Typed(".typing-2", {
        strings: ["Developer", "Designer", "Freelancer"],
        typeSpeed: 100,
        backSpeed: 60,
        loop: true
    });

- ability to add the humburger menu
- ability to created the scroll down page.
